				<p style="text-align:justify";> The combo system in Tekken 7 retains some of the aspects of Tekken Revolution, in which it is no longer possible to bound a character during a combo. However, the bound state still exists, but a lot of moves that use to bound are being taken out.In order to compensate for the lack of bounds, many moves were given new combo dynamics in order to extend combos. </p>
